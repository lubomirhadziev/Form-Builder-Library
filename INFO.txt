This library represents how easy is to create advanced form with just a few classes.
This library saved me many hours writing boring forms.
It's part of the code that serves to generate forms similar to this "GeneratedForm-Preview.png" in the picture.
This library was created by me initially for a project that requires a lot of forms for admin panel. It was created in less than half the time what was intended.
